# Lab: Class 41 Analytics and Text To Speech (Amplify Predictions)

## Overview
Today, your app will start collecting basic, aggregated analytics on user usage, and will also read task descriptions to users out loud.

### Setup
Continue working in your taskmaster repository.

### Resources
* [Amplify Getting Started With Analytics](https://docs.amplify.aws/lib/analytics/getting-started/q/platform/android/)
* [Amplify Getting Started With Predictions](https://docs.amplify.aws/lib/predictions/getting-started/q/platform/android/)
* [Amplify Text To Speech](https://docs.amplify.aws/lib/predictions/text-speech/q/platform/android/)

## Feature Tasks

#### Analytics
On the “Main” activity (and any other activities you like), start recording at least one AnalyticsEvent. Make sure you can view instances of that event, including their custom properties, in Amazon Pinpoint.

#### Text To Speech
On the Task Detail activity, add a button to read out the task’s description using the Amplify Predictions library.

#### Second Predictions Integration
Somewhere in your application, integrate one of the other Amplify Predictions APIs. 
See the possibilities at [Predictions](https://docs.amplify.aws/lib/predictions/getting-started/q/platform/android/#next-steps).

#### Documentation
Update your daily change log with today’s changes. Include a screenshot of the Amazon Pinpoint dashboard with your events and at least one custom property visible.
