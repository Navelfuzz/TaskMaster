# Lab 42: Monetization And AdMob Ads

### Overview
Today, your app will integrate a few different kinds of ads via Google AdMob.

### Setup
Continue working in your taskmaster repository.

## Resources
[AdMob Banner Ads](https://developers.google.com/admob/android/banner)
[AdMob Interstitial Ads](https://developers.google.com/admob/android/interstitial)
[AdMob Rewarded Ads](https://developers.google.com/admob/android/rewarded)

## Feature Tasks

#### Banner Ad
On the “Main” activity, add a banner ad to the bottom of the page and display a Google test ad there.

#### Interstitial Ad
Add a button to the “Main” activity that allows users to see an interstitial ad. (In a real app, 
you’ll want to show this during natural transitions/pauses in your app, but we don’t really have 
that in this application.)

#### Rewarded Ad
Add a button to the “Main” activity that allows users to see a rewarded ad using a Google test ad. 
When the user clicks the close button, the user should see their reward in a text field next to the button.
